Hi I'm Eddy! I'm a student at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton</a> studying a combination of physics and CS/AI. Broadly, I'm interested in tackling problems in energy, space, defense, and AI. 

This summer, I'm working on the ML team at <a href="https://www.distributedspectrum.com/">Distributed Spectrum</a> in an applied research role. Previously, I researched nuclear fusion at the <a href="https://www.lle.rochester.edu/">Laboratory for Laser Energetics</a> advised by Dr. R. Stephen Craxton. I also had stints in labs at Yale and the University of Rochester researching superconductors and quantum computing.

I've also spent some time interning in the Mayor's Office of Rochester, NY, where I grew up. In my own time, I'm always building various applied AI/ML projects, recently in climate and media. Lastly, I take a personal interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making">human decision making</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market">prediction markets</a>.
