Hi I'm Eddy. I'm a student at Princeton studying a combination of physics and CS/AI. Broadly, I'm interested in tackling problems in energy, space, defense, and AI. 

This summer, I'm working on the ML team at <a href="https://www.distributedspectrum.com/">Distributed Spectrum</a> in an applied research role. Previously, I researched nuclear fusion at the <a href="https://www.lle.rochester.edu/">Laboratory for Laser Energetics</a> advised by Dr. R. Stephen Craxton. I also had stints at Yale and the University of Rochester researching superconductors and quantum computing.

I also spent some time interning in the Mayor's Office of Rochester, NY, where I grew up. In my personal time, I'm always building various applied AI/ML projects, recently in climate and media. Lastly, I take a personal interest in human decision making and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market">prediction markets</a>.
